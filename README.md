# My Personal Project

## Intro

This will be an application that will allow the user to choose from a list of **brain games/tests** to
play. There will also be a **leaderboard system** in place for each of the different games. To use the
leaderboard, there will be an account system, with unique usernames for each account. The people who
will use this application are those who are looking for a simple and short game to play or people who
enjoy competing with their friends or other people to get a high score.

I've played many games that are extremely fun, but looks very simple from the outside. I find these 
games very interesting, and I hope to be able to create such a game in the future. 
*[humanbenchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/)* is a website with many examples of these games; this 
website is an inspiration for this project as I will attempt to replicate some of these games. 

## Phase 1 User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create an account.
- As a user, I want to be able to log in and out of my account.
- As a user, I want to be able to change menus (main, games, leaderboards, etc).
- As a user, I want to be able to select a game to play, and play it.
- As a user, I want to be able to record my score onto the leaderboard.
